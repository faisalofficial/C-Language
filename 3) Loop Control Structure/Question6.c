/*
There are in total 21 match sticks to start the game. First we ask the user to pick either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 matches per pick.
Once the user makes his/her pick, computer makes the picking(same rules apply to the computer i.e., it can pick either 
1 or 2 or 3 or 4 matches per pick). The trick is, computers pick is always 5 minus the pick of the user. For example, 
if computers pick is variable c and user pick is stored in variable p, then:
c = 5 â€“ p;
This makes sure computer always wins the game. That is, the last pick will always be of the user.
